ObjectScript is free software distributed under the terms of the MIT license 
reproduced below. ObjectScript may be used for any purpose, including commercial 
purposes, at absolutely no cost. No paperwork, no royalties, no GNU-like "copyleft" 
restrictions, either. Just download it and use it.

The spirit of the ObjectScript license is that you are free to use ObjectScript 
for any purpose at no cost without having to ask me. The only wish is that 
if you do use ObjectScript, then you could give me credit by including the copyright 
notice somewhere in your product or its documentation. A nice, but optional, 
way to give me further credit is to include an ObjectScript logo and a link 
to http://objectscript.org/ in a web page for your product.
